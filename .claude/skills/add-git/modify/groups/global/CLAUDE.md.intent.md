# Intent: groups/global/CLAUDE.md modifications

## What changed
Added a "Git (Main Group Only)" section so agents know they can push/pull from GitHub.

## Key sections

### Git section
- Placed before the "Message Formatting" section
- Documents that git is pre-configured with HTTPS credentials
- Notes this only works in the main group container

## Invariants
- All existing sections remain unchanged
- The formatting rules section stays at the end

## Must-keep
- All existing tool documentation (ntfy, browser, etc.)
- The "Message Formatting" section and its rules
